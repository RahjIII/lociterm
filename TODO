* Suggested games and result should always be logged by server (not a debug)

* config option for verbose suggestion failure message to client.

* CLI db administration mode.

* DB - save first few K of data, for admin review later?

* One time 'suggestion disclaimer' window.

* try to fix TAB and SHIFT TAB in the ui.

* support for CHARSET telnet option, to send UTF-8

* controlable contrast ratio in theme? (can xtermjs do it after setup?)  
	See xtermoptions.minimumContrastRatio

* Work on selectable / alternate menubox layouts for 10-way direction muds.

* put SSL port into the game about.

* terminal reset- put cursor on last line of screen? (read rows from xtermjs, move cursor there.)

  on ipv4, lws will kill the connection 15 seconds after connecting to ipv4.

* Server Get the terminal types and mtts values to be selectable from the
  config file?

* android ime-
	Remains an open issue. :( 
	See: https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/4265
	see ./browser/input/CompositionHelper.ts

* Server lws_daemonize check that.

* Server drop perms after launch?
