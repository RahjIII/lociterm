# Public LociTerm Sites

If you are running a publicly available LociTerm and want to share it with the world, list it here.

The Host field should be a link for people to connect to the default game on
your LociTerm instance. If your site allows players to connect to alternate
games, list the status as "Open".  If it only allows connecting to the default
game, mark it "Dedicated".  The description is up to you!
