1. Dependencies
---------------

Requires libglib2.0-dev, ctags, openssl, cmake, libwebsockets4.4.0, npm, libjson-c-dev

on debian 12-

`apt-get install gcc libglib2.0-dev exuberant-ctags openssl cmake npm libjson-c-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config`

1.a Libwebsockets
-----------------

Libwesockets in debian 11 is the wrong version, and in debian 12
doesn't have the required options compiled in.  So, you've got to get the code
from https://libwebsockets.org/repo/libwebsockets and rebuild it.

Note that for the cmake step....
# -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG will make a debug image of libwebsockets. Not normally used.
# -DLWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS=0 enables permessage deflate, and IS REQUIRED.
# -DLWS_IPV6=ON because in deb 11 at least, that wasn't the default.

cd ~/othercode
git clone https://libwebsockets.org/repo/libwebsockets
cd libwebsockets
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLWS_IPV6=ON -DLWS_WITH_ZLIB=ON -DLWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS=OFF ..
make
sudo make install

2. Building LOciTerm
--------------------
cd into the directory where you found this INSTALL file.

LociTerm will install into /usr/local by default.  If you want it somewhere
else, edit the makefile.  (you may also have to edit lociterm.service use the
correct paths)

To build type "make".

The makefile will run npm to install the packages required by the client, build
the lociterm javascript client files, and then locid proxy binary.  

Assuming all went well... 

The build will place a test launcher into the top level directory that uses a
set of default server options.  Try running "./lociterm" to test launching
lociterm on port 4500.  The launcher should also open a new browser window or
tab to the correct url.  Lociterm will try to connect to a default game running
on localhost 4000.

If that worked, great!

To install lociterm on the system, do "make install".

"make certs" to make some self signed ones if you don't have real ones.

"make systemd" to make locid run as lociterm.service at boot time.

Edit the locid.conf file (installed as /usr/local/etc/locid.conf by default)
and edit any parameters as described in the config file.


3. Proxy rules for apache2
--------------------------
Apache2 can be configured to make LociTerm's webserver available under a normal looking apache url.  

To add proxy rules to apache2:
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
    RewriteRule .* "wss://localhost:4005%{REQUEST_URI}" [P]
    ProxyPass /lociterm https://localhost:4005/
    ProxyPassReverse /lociterm https:///localhost:4005/
    ProxyRequests off
