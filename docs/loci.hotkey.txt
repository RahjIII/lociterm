GMCP Loci.Hotkey

Client must support:  "Loci.Hotkey 2"

	If client claims support, server will send hotkey definition update
	messages asynchronosly, as they become available, at the server's
	discretion. 

	Defined Values for the hotkey "name:" are-
		pgup, pgdn, home, end, f1 - f20


Client to Server: 
	"Loci.Hotkey.Get" { }

	Request for server to send/resend all of the current hotkey definitions to
	the client.  May be sent at any time, or not at all.  Intended use is to
	indicate to server that all previously sent updates may have been lost due
	to a client reset, and need to be resent.  

	"Loci.Hotkey.Edit" {          // (v2 only)
		name: "<keyname>",        // required
		label: "<display label>"  // optional
		macro: "alphanumeric string to set" // optional
		sends: "seq" or "macro"   // optional (v2 only)
	}

	Message from client to server to set a server side hotkey expansion.
	Expectation is that if the server recieves the vt/xterm hotkey sequence, it
	will substitute in the provided macro text.  May be sent at any time, when
	the client wishes to inform the server of a definition or change, such as
	when user edits a hotkey with the client UI.

Server to Client: 
	
	"Loci.Hotkey.Set" { 
		name: "<keyname>",        // required
		label: "<display label>"  // optional
		macro: "alphanumeric string to set" // optional
		sends: "seq" or "macro"   // optional (v2 only)
	}

	Message from server to client containing a hotkey definition.  May be sent
	at any time.  name: is a required field.  label: is a UI display name,
	intended to be used in on-screen buttons.

	The sends: <seq|macro> paramter indicates to the client whether it should
	send a vt/xterm function key sequence, or the text of the macro: parameter
	when a function key is hit.  The macro: string should always be sent with
	at least one terminating '\n' newline character, whether the macro string
	ends in a \n or not.  Note that if the macro: string isn't defined, the
	client should send the vt/xterm function key sequence instead of sending an
	empty line.

	"Loci.Hotkey.Reset" {
		name: "<keyname>"	// optional
	}

	Message from server to client indicating that the hotkey definintion MUST
	be reset to the client default value.  if name: not present, ALL
	definitions MUST be reset to defaults.
