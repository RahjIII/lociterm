To build the loci demon - 
cd src; make

the binary will be in src/locid

------ requirements --------
(libwebsocket)* (libtelnet)* glib-2.0 sqlite3 json-c

  --- libwebsocket ---
Wed Aug  7 12:38:20 PM EDT 2024

Requires libwebsocket to be built and installed locally on debian systems with
these options provided to cmake, to enable IPV6 and websocket per-message
compression.

git clone https://libwebsockets.org/repo/libwebsockets
(or.. 
	git remote update
	git status
	git pull
)
cmake -DLWS_IPV6=1 -DLWS_WITH_ZLIB=ON -DLWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS=OFF ..
make
sudo make install


  --- libtelnet ---
Lociterm includes libtelnet from https://github.com/seanmiddleditch/libtelnet
in its source distribution because the libtelnet that is packaged with debian
from http://github.com/elanthis/libtelnet is stuck on version 0.21 and it is
buggy.

The seanmiddleditch version won't compile as a library, so rather than manually
update the deb package version with the two files from Sean's repo, I just
include those two files locally here and skip the lib.  The version included is
0.23 (or as documented in the libtelnet source, in case I forget to update this
README)
