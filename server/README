SERVER DEVELOPMENT NOTES
------------------------
Generally, you only need to run make from the main lociterm directory.  This
file contains locid server specific development notes that may (or may not)
need integration into the docs.

You can build ./locid in the server/src directory by typing `make` there.  It
will also run from server/src if you create a local.conf file with appropriate
file paths into the dist directory.  This is useful for developing in VIM,
where the 'make' key is often bound to a single keystroke.  (Shift-M, in my
environment.)  Note that if you make from inside the server/src directory, your
./locid binary will NOT inherit the version string assigned to it from the
toplevel makefile, and will probably be identified as a 2.x.0-dev build.

To run under GDB, cd into server/src and run 

gdb --args ./locid -c ./local.conf

Debug flags are on by default, so symbols and source should be available within
the debugger.  



Random notes and reminders follow.  -jsj
------------------------


To build the loci demon - 
cd src; make

the binary will be in src/locid

------ requirements --------
(libwebsocket)* (libtelnet)* glib-2.0 sqlite3 json-c

  --- libwebsocket ---
Wed Aug  7 12:38:20 PM EDT 2024

Requires libwebsocket to be built and installed locally on debian systems with
these options provided to cmake, to enable IPV6 and websocket per-message
compression.

git clone https://libwebsockets.org/repo/libwebsockets
(or.. 
	git remote update
	git status
	git pull
)
cmake -DLWS_IPV6=1 -DLWS_WITH_ZLIB=ON -DLWS_WITHOUT_EXTENSIONS=OFF ..
make
sudo make install


  --- libtelnet ---
Lociterm includes libtelnet from https://github.com/seanmiddleditch/libtelnet
in its source distribution because the libtelnet that is packaged with debian
from http://github.com/elanthis/libtelnet is stuck on version 0.21 and it is
buggy.

The seanmiddleditch version won't compile as a library, so rather than manually
update the deb package version with the two files from Sean's repo, I just
include those two files locally here and skip the lib.  The version included is
0.23 (or as documented in the libtelnet source, in case I forget to update this
README)

  --- glib-2.0 ---
On Debian based sytems- 
apt-get install libglib2.0-dev


  --- sqlite3 ---
On Debian based sytems- 
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

 --- libjson-c-dev ---
On Debian based sytems- 
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
