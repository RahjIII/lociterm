To build the loci demon - 
cd src; make

the binary will be in src/locid

------ requirements --------
  --- libwebsocket ---
Requires libwebsocket to be built and installed locally.

  --- libtelnet (kinda) ---
This code includes libtelnet from https://github.com/seanmiddleditch/libtelnet
because the libtelnet that is packaged with debian from
http://github.com/elanthis/libtelnet is stuck on version 0.21 and it is buggy.

The seanmiddleditch version won't compile as a library, so rather than manually
update the deb package version with the two files from Sean's repo, I just
include those two files locally here and skip the lib.

  --- glib-2.0 ---
