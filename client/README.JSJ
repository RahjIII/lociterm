Commands I've run so far for initial setup...

npm init -y
# --save-dev means the package wont be in the final dist
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
npm install file-loader --save-dev
# npm install copy-webpack-plugin --save-dev

# --save means the package WILL be in the final dist
npm install xterm -save
npm install xterm-addon-web-links -save
npm install xterm-addon-fit -save
npm install xterm-addon-attach -save
npm install xterm-addon-unicode11 -save
npm install xterm-addon-image -save


# I created webpak.config.js by hand from an example.
vi webpack.config.js

# where webpack puts the final product by default
mkdir dist

# default webpack location for the source code you write
mkdir src

# I created src/index.js with vi and edited it.
vi src/index.js

# I created src/index.html with vi and edited it.

# This runs webpack with the defaults
npx webpack

#updated package.json with some build targets so now these work
npm run dev
npm run build 

# added some config to webpack.config.js and package.json to enable a live dev
# server.  you'll want to be running (cd ../server/src; ./locid -c local.conf)
# to have the backend running.
npm run serve


# Note that for testing, this will install the nightly beta of xtermjs
npm install -S xterm@beta --legacy-peer-deps
# this puts it back
npm install -S xterm@5.1.0

# update packages-
# show which are out of date
npm outdated
npm update
# if npm outdated still shows outdated packages, install them @latest
npm outdated
npm install xterm-addon-attach@latest
npm install xterm-addon-fit@latest
npm install xterm-addon-unicode11@latest
npm install xterm-addon-web-links@latest
